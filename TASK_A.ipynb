since August that they should have a test set to evaluate on a later test set.\n","- Every time they try to run it, they find out that it's not as easy as they thought.\n","- For example, the call that PERSON8 had, someone was PERSON8 will send the numbers for the data set to PERSON6 today.\n","- PERSON6 needs them immediately.\n","- PERSON4 is working on the adaptation for the two
