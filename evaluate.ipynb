all invited guests) at the same time.\\n--Create the stamps, use replay scripts and make subtitles in all languages and be available for all the guests.\\n--FFM peg streams will be run in the web server.\\n---The problem can be identification of the video and start of the test and machine translation on cascade.\\n--During demo 2 machines will be used: one to run the set up and the other one to talk with VS.\\n--The project officer will see the video through shared screen with VLC, video can be put into a presentation platform or beg the participants to connect to the public URL.\\n--To provide sounds to clients they set the sound input to the sound output and run the record on loopback sound device.\\n--Project officer will focus on quality of the translation.\\n--The suggestion is to start the show and recognition at the same time.\\n--Transcribing and translating the speech as meetings go.\\n\\n\\n-Demo set up methods\\n--Re-broadcasting with Youtube.\\n--Using Youtube included Youtube iFrame within presentation platform.\\n---It shows a video and the pre-recorded one will be substitled and then show the intructions.\\n--The idea is to log in on the [ORGANIZATION5] server, bypass M3U8 URL and put it on the web server, that exposes SSL certificate then upload video, make it demo and run FFM peg to stream the video and provide output to start the transcription.\\n---FFM peg needs to be installed to run the pipe on [ORGANIZATION5] server.\\n---Running the SLT system while streaming is using too much internet connection.\\n\\n\\n-Testing the set up\\n--First there would be the instructions and the injection would stop release the worker and the pipeline will start.\\n---Needs to be tested to avoid delay.\\n--German TEDx talks were tested with the current best set up.\\n---The English segmentation was better than the German one.\\n--Using Youtube subtitles (that has a human and automatic transcription) with translations would be a good solution.\\n---There can be a problem with accents of languages so the recognition can be misleading.\\n--They need to test connection fails to know how to recover from it the quickest.\\n\\n\\n-Conclusion: findings, complications, optimizations, decisions\\n--[ORGANIZATION6] mediator can make translation of one language, Gitrepo would be better option for multiple translations.\\n--If they use Youtube there can be some problem due to Youtube Fair Use.\\n--Showing how to insert test text into [ORGANIZATION6] presenter.\\n--Providing sound outputs should be working through T command.\\n---A solution if they could not create a public fronted URL.\\n\\nMinutes submitted by: [ANNOTATOR1]\\n\\n\\n'],\n                          'meeting_en_dev_003':

Goal is to describe the project and invite more people to join. \\n- Domain adaptation is needed. NLP and [PROJECT2] has same domain adaptation.\\n• Inform about Students FirmsFare, 18th – 20th March:\\n- Important for data collection.\\n- Very noisy environment.\\n- It is necessary to add profanity filtering. Bad words and words related to bad topics.\\n- \\n[PERSON16]:\\n• Worked on data collection in English and [OTHER3]. Have 1970 – 1980 pdf files. Now is needed to clean all the data.\\n\\n[PERSON3]:\\n• Work on compress and decompress of the sound.\\n• Work on multi-source model output.\\n\\n[PERSON17]:\\n• Finished evaluation framework. Used different segmentations – wordbase and timebase.\\n• Now complete files to test it and working on the paper.\\n\\n[PERSON14] and [PERSON2] discuss problematic setting. Idea of breaking in a small chunks and use the existing timestamps to break the long recording into shorter once.\\n\\n[PERSON17] and [PERSON3] agreed that [PERSON3] create the list of files and will send that.\\n\\n\\n\\n[PERSON7]:\\n• Experimented with various technics and especially like domain adaptation of a language model and then acoustic finding on [PERSON4] talk.\\n• Now working on a next version of the czech ASR system that should be trained on even more data.\\n\\n[PERSON2]:\\n• Discuss with [PERSON14] about kind of compression. [PERSON3] and [PERSON11] test it. \\n• Guess that systems are actually good with mp3 compression.\\n• Was working on sound segmentation. Problem with ASR system because some words get cut. Now continue with decoding. Window 4 – 8 seconds long.\\n• Trained the transformer converting the audio into graphians and tested the settings. Actual translation with the transformer was quite bad. \\n• Prepare segmenter for Monday 17th.\\n\\n[PERSON8]:\\n• [PERSON14] introduce [PERSON8].\\n• Worked on paraphrasing, actualy waiting for virtual machine. \\n• Inform about [ORGANIZATION3] FastSpeech.

[ORGANIZATION11], [ORGANIZATION2], and [ORGANIZATION6]\\n\\nOrganization of the IWSLT presentations\\n- There is organized a panel and there will always have 2 time slots for the presentation of the papers.\\n- The papers, also the presentations, can be pre-recorded.\\n- Decision that one panel is enough and isn t needed to organize another one.\\n- Will be needed to have probably pre-recorded summary of the results, presentation.\\n- Will be received a request from the main organizers to prepare a video for the [PROJECT5] submission.\\n- There is only one slot to present the overall results and the rest is hopefully done across all the tasks.\\n- Latest proposal was that paper will be exactly podcast, twice at 9 am and 6 pm Seattle time.\\n- Different speakers or papers will be pre-recorded, 20 minutes poster, 5 minutes pre-recording talks.\\n- Use of the IWSLT shared task to chose the best systems and also to validate, whether the evaluation is screwed up or whether it is actually correct.\\n- Ask for send the Overleaf link for the slides as as soon as start with Overleaf for the slides.\\n- The deadline for the recorded demo is the 17th of June.\\n\\nPostponed review\\n- It is needed to figure out the date.\\n- Because the review will postpone till September and is needed to get to project officer a new date.\\n\\nFinancial tables\\n- This is a preparation for the new official submission.\\n- Normally are the final numbers provided at the earliest 2 weeks or 3 weeks after the respective month has ended.\\n- The 1st period, which is reviewed end with June, it is not possible to have the official numbers from our part earlier then in mid July, or towards the end of July.\\n- The [ORGANIZATION7] gives us 2 months actually to finalize these numbers.\\n- The financial tables are asked for with the deadline of May for a testing purposes.\\n- Also there is double check that are sent the numbers that we understand and then can put together.\\n- That everything makes sense already before the final dates.\\n- Expect that at the boundary of July and August, there would be needed paper with necessary and especially in respective financial departments.\\n- [ORGANIZATION5] is missing but doesn't expect any problems.\\n- The only thing is that it has be done by finance department.\\n- [ORGANIZATION5] financial department will be connected to [PROJECT5].\\n- The numbers will be approximate, but it's to test whether we understand each other.\\n- Then in July, it would be easy to get the final numbers.\\n\\nNLP technologies\\n- It is needed to chose the reviewer for the report on NLP technologies.\\n- It could even be [ORGANIZATION5].\\n- Because it is a workshop, which was planned and once it happens for lay people, so for people not familiar with NLP technologies at all.\\n- The reviewer on spoken language translation is mentioned in [ORGANIZATION12] doc.\\n- Then were chosen [ORGANIZATION5] review person.\\n- Also is chosen reviewer for the project management guide initial and updates.\\n\\nReport and dissemination\\n- Report, that has to be written by [ORGANIZATION5], but everybody should contribute their data.\\n- Ask for make sure to enter all dissemination activities remote, or in person, which obviously was limited, into the continuous reporting table.\\n- More input is needed, especially in the scientific dissemination part and the workshop and NLP technologies.\\n- The workshop actually did not take place.\\n- There were preparations, when did any dry run sessions happen, what was the planned content of the workshops, or the like the the workshop as package is essentially ready.\\n- It was just not delivered because the Covid crisis.\\n- Ask about published paper in dissemination sheet.\\n- Regular paper submissions, which have a conference presentation, would not put them into this table.\\n- Put here all the things that are not associated with the paper.\\n- The table with the papers will be sum of the dissemination activities.\\n- Put the papers into our bibliographical system.\\n- Examine what has to be done, and it will be get known in a week or 2 the format of the papers.\\n- Assignment for UK - figure out the official format of the papers and system, which already handles these papers.\\n\\nOverleaf\\n- All the main authors responsible sites know the status of each of the deliverables.\\n- Reminder that it should be done essentially by the end this week or on Monday.\\n- Then it should be sent it to reviewer of the deliverable, reviewer has 2 weeks to processes that and then there is 1 week to incorporate the changes.\\n- It is needed to submit all these deliverables at the latest on the last of June.\\n\\nWorkshop preparations\\n- Inform about confusing milestones report.\\n- It is needed to find out what exactly should be done for an event, which has a milestone, but the event has not taken place.\\n\\nCongress date\\n- New congress date is from 30th of May to the 3rd of June 2021 and the workshop itself will be on the 1st June.\\n- Ask for block these dates.\\n\\nDemo\\n- [ORGANIZATION2] waiting for the all-clear report and with all service have come up successfully again.\\n- Some of the file service are still doing file system checks, but it should be back to operation walls.\\n- There should be the new date with the project officer.\\n- Ask for prepare internal pole and quicly filling.\\n- Best week for the demo would be around the 15th, in the 2nd half of June.\\n- It is not needed to check the demo because it is regularly checked.\\n- Important message is that there actually should have been all components replicated at some other sides.\\n- The system still weren't provide to the others.\\n- Actually, our side is now the least safe for this demo.\\n- There were proposed a dockerisation.\\n- The docker weren't used our servers because of these pseudo access needs, and it has been done on some virtual machines.\\n- Recommendation to said that have to a route once to set the permission on the docker socket and make user part of the docker group, but after that there is not needed to run docker.\\n- In principle, there can the docker containers run without root.\\n- IT system are no docker on cluster and they have virtual machines, which are okay for running docker.\\n- Because we have the ASR systems for Czech, that's [PROJECT2] based, also some Jasper based, but these are not integrated yet because of the missing segmentation.\\n- And there is [PERSON13] or [PROJECT4] systems.\\n- Agreed on made sure, that the ASR systems could be run at [ORGANIZATION2] and the translation systems in [ORGANIZATION11].\\n- [PROJECT2] and punctuator are CPU based.\\n- For space, or another virtual machine is the only open point GPU configuration.\\n- There must be replicated components across the site.\\n- It is needed to avoid updating the systems before the demo.\\n- There should be a production system and a development system, a complete setup.\\n- The production system has to be stable without any new segmenters, any new updates for a long period of time.\\n- The pipeline is pretty complex and is sensitive to all the little details.\\n- Ask all the partners to avoid doing any updates to their workers shortly, perhaps two weeks, before the demo.\\n- Aside from the the bomb and and power outage it [ORGANIZATION2], this also put the demo at very big risk.\\n- But it is candidate for a thing, which if it work an if it was well integrated, it will be great to demo it.\\n- There is also working on the [PROJECT5] test set, which will cover further language pairs and set-ups than the IWSLT shared task.\\n- Ladder climbing needs that we'll be regularly testing a new models and new components in the pipeline and putting all the results into one single table and that will tell us, what is our current best technology for this particular set-up.\\n- The fingerprinting is quite good to separate the versions of the modules.\\n- The frozen fingerprints would be then the thing to demo.\\n- Starting with this software engineering request to properly separate diploid versions and then the proper staging of the systems.\\n- This would allow to directly evaluate, which systems are the best.\\n- The main message is that there will be a number of demo, dry run sessions again and the date for the demo will be chosen, and will be chose and freeze the fingerprints for the demo.\\n\\nTime extension\\n- Agree, that by mid next week everybody should fill the table by how many months would you like the project to be extended.\\n- Decide on June 8th and ask for the extension before June 15th.\\n\\n\",\n                           \"Purpose of meeting:

everybody in person.\\n--- There are related problems due to the situation: the [ORGANIZATION4] is closed and it currently does not give out visas.\\n--- Reached decision: as soon as the [ORGANIZATION4] starts giving out visas, he will come to [LOCATION2]. \\n\\n- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT6].\\n-- Waiting for [ORGANIZATION3], the communication with them is not perfect. \\n-- Some issues have been raised by colleagues from [ORGANIZATION3].\\n--- For example, there is a problem with the quality estimation.\\n-- The colleagues from [ORGANIZATION3] are currently preparing leaflets to hand out to participants. \\n-- All in all, just waiting for [ORGANIZATION3]. \\n\\n- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT1]. \\n-- Currently trying the back translation.\\n-- Will try to run the translation on CPUs to make it quicker. \\n\\n- Discussing the progress of [PROJECT4].\\n-- No major updates.\\n-- Discussing a related paper, in which the authors trained a model to do the evaluation.\\n--- Skeptical about machine learned evaluation methods.\\n--- Not sure how/if it can be implemented right now.  \\n--- What might be useful is a pre-trained model that is then fine-tuned during training.\\n--- It would be useful for distinguishing in paraphrasing.\\n---- But this needs to be looked into in more detail. \\n-- Discussing if there is really a need for this new non-standard metric for evaluation in MT.\\n--- Yes, it will be used for paraphrasing. \\n--- This metric is semantically sensitive. \\n--- This metric will be used to estimate semantic similarity, but still have the constraints to enforce distinction.\\n--- By using this metric, semantic similarity is guaranteed.\\n--- The metric will guarantee that the paraphrase does not stray away from the original meaning too far. \\n--- We can try adding as many constraints we want to see how many we can add until the meaning is lost completely.\\n---- Meaning and losing meaning would be a valuable topic to focus on, since none of the papers on constraint decoding focus on it. \\n-- Later, before publishing the paper, evaluation should be also done manually. \\n-- All of this can be considered later, but it is a good start. \\n\\nMinutes submitted by: [ANNOTATOR7]\\n',\n                           \"[PROJECT3] CZ\\nDate: 31. 08. 2020\\nAttendees: [PERSON10], [PERSON2], [PERSON6], [PERSON3],
